# The Panel

**In heavy development at the moment, do not use.**

See The Panel in action on [Burrrst](http://burrrst.nl) (mostly dutch).

[The Panel](http://thepanel.io) is a [Laravel](http://laravel.com) package that allows you to curate links with a group of people with Laravel. The links only appear in public when a certain amount of votes are being given to a link. 

Visit [The Panel Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/BdRVX1XM/the-panel) for todos and issues.

## Setup

- Working on it

## Known issues

- I'm ([@reinier](https://twitter.com/reinier)) pretty new to this open source stuff, so one of the main reasons to open source this is to get experience with it.
